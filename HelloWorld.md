##This is an R Markdown document.

In this trial of adding the doc to github 
* cloned repo from github online because I couldnt push anything there from creating in locally
* created a .md file in Rstudio and saved in in folder from online
* no git init because file already exists
* git add
* git commit 
* git push origin master
* password doesn't show characters but it's typing


Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
